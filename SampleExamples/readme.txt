This readme file gives an idea about the Sample input and output files.
As visible, the input files are present in the input folder. The output files are present in the output folder.
In input files 0.txt and 1.txt each input file has a single cluster, each output file corresponding to that has each sub-cluster in individual lines.
In input file 2.txt, the input file and output files are same, because our algorithm found the cluster cannot be broken into further subclusters
in a comprehensive manner.
